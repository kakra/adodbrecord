==========

Since I developed with Rails using the ultra-comfortable ActiveRecord I
felt the need for a similar solution in PHP. Googling around I found some
people saying this is impossible. That’s true: Ruby’s OOP implementation
is in many ways superior to PHP’s.

But anyway I decided: Some of ActiveRecords comfort must be possible in
PHP. I’ve decided to build on AdoDB for PHP since it already does the
heavy lifting of database abstraction very good.

The interface is currently very limited and should be very self
explanatory. For all interested hackers I’ve set up a git repository
at GitHub and would be very interested on your feedback.

This project grew out of the need to ease up database development in an
already existing legacy application. It’s not meant as an exact
ActiveRecord replacement in PHP – just similar in convenience.
